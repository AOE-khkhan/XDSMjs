## XDSM
The XDSM (eXtended Design Structure Matrix) is a notation used to visualize MDO processes. 
It was developed by A. B. Lambe and J. R. R. A. Martins, see [MDOLab website dedicated page.](http://mdolab.engin.umich.edu/content/xdsm-overview)

XDSM permissions:
> If you use the XDSM format for research, we ask that you cite the following journal publication in your work:
> A. B. Lambe and J. R. R. A. Martins, “Extensions to the Design Structure Matrix for the Description of Multidisciplinary Design, Analysis, and Optimization Processes”, Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization, vol. 46, no. 2, p. 273-284, 2012.

## Description
XDSMjs is a javascript generator allowing to display a XDSM diagram within a web page. 
It is based on [D3](https://d3js.org/) and [Mathjax](https://www.mathjax.org/).
Compared to the original latex generator it uses a json format as input (see example xdsm.json).

## Usage
* Open xdsm.html in your browser (tested with Firefox) 
* To see other diagrams, copy a json example from `examples` directory as xdsm.json and reload the page. 

## Troubleshooting
* If you don't see a diagram, may be you need to serve the files with your favourite HTTP server (same origin policy of your browser). An example with python:
```
> cd <install-dir>/XDSMjs
> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8020
```
then open `http://localhost:8020/xdsm.html` in a browser.
